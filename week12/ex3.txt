First, I created 1gb file. I made slight changes in code in order to print size of buffer, so now all the results are clear:
10

real    4m55,955s
user    1m3,104s
sys     3m47,947s
 
Really a lot, which is obvious with such a small buffer

1024

real    0m11,940s
user    0m0,594s
sys     0m3,085s

Not so much as before, as a buffer is one hundred times increased. 

1000000

real    0m10,978s
user    0m0,000s
sys     0m1,890s

Even faster, but obviously not proportional, as other operations take more time than flushing buffer.
